📈 Time-Series Forecasting – ARIMA & Prophet

This project demonstrates time-series forecasting using two popular approaches:
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) from statsmodels
Prophet from Meta (Facebook)
We forecast simulated monthly sales data and compare results visually.

📌 About Time-Series Forecasting

Time-series forecasting is the process of predicting future values based on previously observed data. It is widely used in:

Sales forecasting

Stock price prediction

Weather forecasting

Demand planning

Two common approaches used here:

ARIMA – A statistical model for stationary series.

Prophet – A robust model for seasonality, trend, and holiday effects.

📊 Project Overview

Data: Simulated monthly sales (2020–2024)

Models Used:

ARIMA (p=2, d=1, q=2)

Prophet (automatic seasonality detection)

Goal: Compare forecasts from ARIMA and Prophet.

⚙️ Workflow

Data Simulation

Generate 60 months of sales data with trend and noise.

Data Visualization

Plot the original sales data.

ARIMA Forecast

Fit ARIMA model (2, 1, 2) on sales data.
Forecast 12 months ahead.

Prophet Forecast

Format data for Prophet (ds, y format).

Train model and predict next 12 months.

Comparison Plot

Plot original data + ARIMA forecast + Prophet forecast.

📊 Sample Output Chart

(Sample visualization – values will vary depending on random seed)

The chart includes:

Black line → Original sales data

Red line → ARIMA forecast

Blue line → Prophet forecast

Dashed gray line → Forecast start

💡 Key Learnings

How to simulate time-series data for experiments.

How to fit and forecast using ARIMA in statsmodels.

How to use Prophet for trend + seasonality forecasting.

How to visualize and compare multiple forecasting models.

📌 How to Run
bash
Copy
Edit
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/time-series-forecasting.git
cd time-series-forecasting

# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels prophet

# Run the script
python forecasting.py

🔮 Next Steps

Use a real-world dataset (e.g., stock prices, energy consumption).

Tune ARIMA parameters (p, d, q) automatically using auto_arima.

Add seasonality & holiday effects in Prophet.

Evaluate forecast accuracy using metrics like MAPE or RMSE.
